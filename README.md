# 3D Car Game

## Project
  A prototype 3D Car Game that I made in 5 days.
  Every level, you have to move your car to the target position while not hitting any obstacle.
  When your car reaches the target, a new car spawns. The previous car will be in replay mode.
## Controls
  Left button to rotate car left.
  Right button to rotate car right.

## Editor
  In Editor mode, you must add Managers and input controls prefab into your scene. You can add your car spawner prefab as many as you want. The game finds all spawners in the scene before starts and sets the number of cars. After that, the game spawns cars via using spawner ID.
  You can add a moveable obstacle.
## Compatibility
Tested for Android (Android version 11) -
